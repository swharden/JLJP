# JLJP annotated source code

**This is an experimental branch of JLJP designed to:**

  * Be easier to study
  * Be easier to test
  * Be easier to translate to other languages

**These goals will be achieved by:**

  * Eliminating all GUI components
  * Verbosely exposing intermediate math steps
  * Eliminating state wherever possible
  * Refactoring down to small classes with procedural methods
  * Using expressive variable, method, and property names
  * Citing authoritative manuscripts in code
